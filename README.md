## Customization
SignMaker is highly customizable.  The `config` directory contains configuration files that can customize the interface, data, and functionality of SignMaker.

### Messages
The text file `messages.js` contains a list of configurable messages for the various user interface languages.

    var messages = {
        en: {
            language: 'English',
            signmaker: 'SignMaker',
 
### Keyboard
The text file `keyboard.js` contains a list of configurable keyboard actions that can be tailored for the various keyboards.

    var keyboard = {
        left10: [37,'shiftKey'],
        left: [37],

### Alphabet
The text file `alphabet.js` contains a list of configurable group of symbols keys that controls the arrangement of the symbol palette.  The files contains the entire ISWA 2010 as arranged by Valerie Sutton.

    window.alphabet = {
        S10000: ["S10000", "S10110", ...
        S10e00: ["S10e00", "S10f10", ...

The `alphabet` subdirectory can contain language specific subsets of the ISWA 2010.  Subsets are based on sign language dictionaries of [SignPuddle Online][sp-org], recreated daily.  Subsets are [available on SignBank][sb-alphabet].  Download the desired alphabet subsets and place in the `alphabet` subdirectory.

### Dictionary
The text file `dictionary.js` is a multi-line file, with one dictionary entry per line.  Each line starts with a Formal SignWriting  string, followed by one or more spoken language terms, separated by tabs.

    window.dict = "";
    dict += "AS14c20S27106M518x529S14c20481x471S27106503x489	hello\n";
    dict += "M522x551S18711488x449S18719495x479S2e800507x504S2e818479x518S20500493x473S2fb04498x545    world    globe\n";

The `dictionary` subdirectory can contain language specific dictionaries.  Dictionaries are custom export of the sign language dictionaries of [SignPuddle Online], recreated daily.  Dictionaries are [available on SignBank][sb-dictionary].  Download the desired dictionaries and place in the `dictionary` subdirectory.
